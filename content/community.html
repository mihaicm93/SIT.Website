            Our community is like a small discord server; while we focus primarily on Escape From Tarkov, SPT-AKI and related
            projects / games. No politics, no discussion of cheats, just fun and modding/programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            We gladly help out new members with setting up the project to get started, and actively work on mods to
            customize SPT-AKI's experience to our liking. It is fully ran by the community. Want to be part of our
            choccy milk loving pub? Feel free to join right in!
